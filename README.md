# BabyName_Analysis

My lovely niece was born this year and my family took almost a week to decide what name to give her. We wanted to give her a pretty and trendy name. From this experience, I had thought it would be fun to analyze baby names reported to the government. I found a dataset from SSA (Social Security Administration) and analyzed it. I found top N names based on categories and I am planning to visualize the analysis with Tableau because in my opinion, it would be more useful when the data is combined with an interactive dashboard.
