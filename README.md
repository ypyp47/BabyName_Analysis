# BabyName_Analysis

My lovely niece was born this year and my family took almost a week to decide what name to give her. We wanted to give her a pretty and trendy name. From this experience, I thought it would be useful to analyze baby names reported to the government. I found a dataset from SSA (Social Security Administration) and analyzed it. I found top N names based on categories. 

I visualized the dat with Tableau because in my opinion, it would be more useful when the data is combined with an interactive dashboard. Moreover, it is fun to explore names with year, sex, state, and name filters. Check it out https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ypyp47/viz/USBabyNameAnalysis/Dashboard1.
